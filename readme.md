# Integrated Network Hub using Cisco Packet Tracer


## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the configuration and operation of several essential server services, including FTP, HTTP, DNS, DHCP, and Email, using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project is designed to simulate a network with a central server providing these services to various devices, including PCs, laptops, and printers. The network is built to emulate a realistic environment where these services interact seamlessly to ensure smooth connectivity and communication between devices.



## Objective of the Project
The primary objectives of this project are:
- **Establish Seamless Communication**: Ensure devices can interact with the server and utilize its services effectively.
- **Deploy and Test Server Services**: Implement services like FTP, HTTP, DNS, DHCP, and Email.
- **Validate Service Functionality**: Confirm that the server services are up and accessible to all connected devices.
- **Simulate Real-World Scenarios**: Provide a practical demonstration of how server services work in a network setup.



## Network Design and Topology
The network topology features a centralized server providing essential services (FTP, HTTP, DNS, DHCP, Email). The server is connected to a main switch, which is further connected to other switches that serve client devices (PCs, laptops, and printers). The network is segmented into multiple subnets to simulate a real-world enterprise network, ensuring the effective operation of server services.

Key elements of the topology include:
- **Central Server**: Hosts all essential services.
- **Switch-Based Segmentation**: Devices are segmented into different subnets.
- **Devices**: PCs, laptops, and printers interact with the server.
- **Router**: Connects different subnets and enables routing between them.



## Server Services Implemented
The project configured five crucial services on the central server:
1. **DHCP**: Dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices.
2. **DNS**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
3. **HTTP**: Hosts a simple web server for local browsing.
4. **FTP**: Enables secure file transfer between devices.
5. **Email**: Allows devices to send and receive emails.



## Configuration Process
The server and network devices were configured step-by-step:
1. **Server Setup**: Assigned a static IP and enabled necessary services.
2. **DHCP Configuration**: Defined IP ranges, subnet masks, and other settings.
3. **DNS Configuration**: Set up domain name resolution for devices.
4. **HTTP Configuration**: Hosted a simple webpage on the server.
5. **FTP Configuration**: Enabled FTP service and tested file transfers.
6. **Email Configuration**: Set up email accounts and tested communication between devices.
7. **Client Device Configuration**: Configured devices (PCs, laptops, printers) to connect to the server services.



## Testing and Validation
Various tests were conducted to validate the functionality of each service:
1. **Network Connectivity**: Verified the communication between devices and the server.
2. **DHCP**: Ensured devices received proper IP addresses.
3. **DNS**: Tested domain name resolution.
4. **HTTP**: Accessed the hosted web page from client devices.
5. **FTP**: Tested file upload/download functionality.
6. **Email**: Ensured email communication was operational.
7. **Printer Functionality**: Validated printing operations.



## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of essential server services within a simulated network environment using Cisco Packet Tracer. The configuration of services like FTP, HTTP, DNS, DHCP, and Email provides valuable insight into how server services function in modern networks. The testing and validation phase confirms the reliable operation of these services, ensuring their proper integration and functionality.
